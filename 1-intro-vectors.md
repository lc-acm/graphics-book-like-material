# Chapter 1: Intro to Vectors

For reasons that may not yet be evident to you, the language and laws of something we call *vectors* will be of extreme importance to you throughout this course. Vectors sometimes follow rules that might not be super intuitive, so this document should help iron out the basics of the ways that vectors work in this course (and in general).

## 1.1 What *is* a Vector?

Something that makes vectors espeically confusing is that the definition of a vector changes depending on who you ask. If you ask a physicist, they'll say something like "a vector is a quantity that has a magnitude and a direction", while a mathematician will say "a vector is an object that can be added and scaled", and a computer scientist would say "a vector is a list of numbers". 

These are all true, and are in fact different ways of stating the nature of vectors in ways that are more useful for applications their respective fields. In this course, we're mostly going to focus on the physical interpretation of a vector (magnitude and direction), but we'll spend some time with the other definitions of vectors as well.

The most important thing to remember is that vectors are a mathematical tool that we can use to help us do geometry and physics and (in this course) model and transform objects in a computer simulation.

Let's go back to that physical definition of a vector: **A vector is a thing that has magnitude and direction**. Unpacking that statement a bit, we can think of a vector like an arrow, pointing in a direction, as shown below:
