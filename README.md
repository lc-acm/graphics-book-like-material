# graphics-"textbook"

Lewis & Clark's computer graphics course - CS 367 - builds upon a huge amount of background knowledge that not all students enrolled in the course may have. This document is meant to serve as a companion to the in-class instruction, and help fill in common sources of confusion in the class material.

This guide is NOT a replacement for attending class, and will not provide solutions to labs. It will, hopefully, serve as a useful reference which students can consult for additional information.
