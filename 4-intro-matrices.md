# Chapter 4: Intro to Matrices

Similarly to our chapter about Vectors, this chapter introduces a somewhat obscure mathematical construction that will at some point soon become incredibly important to your graphics education. Enter "The Matrix".

The Matrix is simply a 2-dimensional arrangement of numbers that we can use to easily keep track of certain types of mathematical operatons. Using matrices will be of great help to us when we work with graphical objects, especially vectors.
