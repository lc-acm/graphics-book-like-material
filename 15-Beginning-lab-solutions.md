You should not be accessing this page unless you have already completed a practice lab and are hoping to check your work. We're using the honor system here so no peeking! We won't be providing answers to any of the in-class labs on this page but encourage you to look over the notes again, go into Jeff's office hours (if you're at L&C), or come into the ACM's C-Space hours if you need extra help.
