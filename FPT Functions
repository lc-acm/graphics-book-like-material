# Chapter 2: FPT Functions

The FPT graphics functions will be new for most of you. FPT stands for "Freshman Programming Toolkit" and is Jeff's version of a graphics library that allows us to draw graphics on most operating systems in C. If you need help downloading FPT to your personal computer, visit LINK

## Setting up a window

The first thing you're going to need to do if you want anything to pop up is create a graphics window. One super important note is that you can't do anything else graphics wise until you have initiated a window (so no changing colors or calling functions that use graphics functions until you initilize the window!).  You'll do this by using 

G_init_graphics(width, height);  

You can make the window any size but it will be in pixels so think windows around 600-1000 size wise.
